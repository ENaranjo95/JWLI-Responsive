        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>The Japanese Women's Leadership Initiative (JWLI) was founded in 2006 by three visioinary women in Boston, Massachusetts: Atsuko Toko Fish, Mary Lassen, and Catherine Crane Coburn. JWLI brings emerging women leaders, referred to as the Fellows, from Japan to Boston to receive four weeks hands-on experience and training with successful nonprofit organizations in nonprofit management and leadership development. During their stay in Boston, the Fellows will develop an Action Plan, which will serve as a step-by-step roadmap to amke their dreams of social change a reality. After returning to Japan, the Fellows are expected to make a difference in their communities based on their Action Plans. The purpose of this program is for the fellows to share the knowledge and experience they acquired in Boston with other women and social sector leaders within Japan.</p>
        <p>The Fish Family Foundation, operating in conjunction with other Boston-based nonprofit organizations, is administering JWLI in partnership with Simmons College School of Management Center for Gender in Organizations.</p>
        <p>In 2010, thanks to the generous funding provided by the U.S. - Japan Foundation. JWLI expanded its vision to hold public forums within Japan. Held in 2010, 2012 and 2013, these public forums provided information about the nonprofit sector and the American approach to philanthropy with hopes to inspire women to take leadership roles. The forum Program reached hundreds of Japanese citizens, advocating for their involvement in addressing the needs of Japnese society.</p>
